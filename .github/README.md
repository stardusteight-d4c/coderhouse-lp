 Coderhouse, Landing Page
</h1>

The project consists of recreating the Coderhouse landing page, an online education platform focused on technology. For this, modern technologies were used, including React.js as the main library for building the user interface, and Next.js as the framework for server-side rendering and routing.

Project dependencies include:
<br /><br />
<strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>: A utility CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive layouts and styles.
<br /><br />
<strong>Embla Carousel React</strong>: A responsive image carousel library to display featured content interactively.
<br /><br />
<strong>React Awesome Reveal</strong>: A library for creating elegant and responsive reveal animations.
<br /><br />
<strong>React Countup</strong>: A library for creating numeric counting animations, useful for displaying statistics or dynamic numbers.
<br /><br />
<strong>Radix UI React Icons</strong>: A library of scalable SVG icons to add visual elements to the interface.
<br /><br />
<strong>Class Variance Authority</strong>: A library for generating variation classes based on property modifications.
<br /><br />
<strong>Clsx</strong>: A library for conditionally generating style classes based on logical expressions.
<br /><br />
<strong>PostCSS and Autoprefixer</strong>: Tools for post-compilation CSS style processing.
<br /><br />
<strong>TypeScript</strong>: A typed programming language that offers advanced typing features to help you develop more robust applications.

These tools and libraries were used to create a faithful recreation of the Coderhouse landing page, with a responsive layout, elegant animations, highlight carousels, and dynamic numeric counters. The project was also developed with a focus on maintainability and scalability, taking advantage of TypeScript to ensure code integrity and early error detection.

Coderhouse's recreated landing page was designed with a special focus on modern design, intuitive usability, and interactive dynamics to provide an engaging experience for users.

- Modern Design:

  - The landing page design is clean, modern, and visually appealing. The use of minimalist design elements, vibrant colors, and readable fonts contribute to a sophisticated, professional aesthetic.

- Intuitive Usability:

  - The usability of the landing page was carefully considered to ensure users can easily navigate and find relevant information quickly and intuitively. The arrangement of elements, such as the navigation menu, call-to-action buttons and content sections, was designed to guide users through the site in a clear and efficient way.

- Dynamics and Interactivity:
  - The landing page is dynamic and interactive, thanks to the use of various libraries and tools. Responsive image carousel provides a visually appealing experience by highlighting featured content in a dynamic and animated way. Reveal animations add a touch of elegance and interactivity, drawing users' attention to important elements on the page. Additionally, dynamic numeric counters provide real-time updated information, such as statistics on enrolled students or courses offered, adding an element of dynamism and interest to the website.
- Responsiveness and Adaptability:
  - The landing page is completely responsive and adaptable to different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and optimized experience on mobile devices, tablets and desktops. This is achieved through the use of the Tailwind CSS framework, which makes it easy to create responsive and flexible layouts.

In summary, Coderhouse's recreated landing page combines modern design, intuitive usability and interactive dynamics to provide an engaging experience for users, encouraging content exploration and promoting a positive impression of the brand.
